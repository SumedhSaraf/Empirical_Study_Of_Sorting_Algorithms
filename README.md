# Empirical_Study_Of_Sorting_Algorithms
### This project deals with study of performance of sorting Algorithms like Selection Sort,Quick Sort,Merge Sort,Heap Sort and Quick Sort.
    - It also tries to calculate the algorithmic constant values by studying the time taken for sorting huge number of inputs.An attempt is 
      also made to come up with a more optimized algorithm by combining various algorithms.
    - These are graphs plotted after recording the performance of each Algorithm against time.
    -  For more details go through the report
### X axis reperesnts number of inputs
### Y axis represents time taken to sort the corresponding inputs in milliseconds.
